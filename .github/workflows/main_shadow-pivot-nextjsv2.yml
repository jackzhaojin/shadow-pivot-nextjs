      # The following steps enable Docker layer caching in GitHub Actions.
      # This persists the npm install and other Docker build layers between builds,
      # so future builds are much faster as long as your dependencies do not change.
      # The cache is stored in GitHub Actions cache storage and restored on each run.
      # See chat context for details and rationale.
