# TSLA Dashboard Feature Development – Conversation Summary

## Overview

This chat documents the process of creating a new TSLA stock and sentiment dashboard feature in a Next.js project. The work included setting up a new feature branch, creating a new route and feature module, updating navigation, and following React/Next.js best practices.

---

## Conversation Summary

- **Branching:**  
  Created and switched to a new local branch:  
  `feature/tsla-dashboard-ui-v1`

- **Feature & Routing:**  
  - Added a new route at `/tsla-dashboard` (`app/tsla-dashboard/page.tsx`).
  - Stubbed a new feature module in `features/tsla-dashboard/` with:
    - `TslaDashboard.tsx` (main dashboard component)
    - `components/PriceGraph.tsx` and `components/SentimentGraph.tsx` (placeholder graph components)
    - `TslaDashboard.module.css` (feature-scoped styles)

- **Home Page Navigation:**  
  - Updated the Home page to link to the new dashboard.
  - Refactored the `DeployButton`:
    - Changed text to “TSLA Dashboard”
    - Switched from an `<a>` tag to Next.js `<Link>` for internal navigation
    - Removed the external Vercel deployment link

- **Best Practices:**  
  - Used Next.js `<Link>` for internal navigation to enable client-side routing and incremental rendering.
  - Scoped new styles to the feature module to avoid global style pollution.

## Detailed Change Log

1. **Branch Creation**
   - Ran:  
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature/tsla-dashboard-ui-v1
     ```
   - Purpose: Isolate development for the TSLA dashboard UI.

2. **New Route and Feature Module**
   - Created [page.tsx](http://_vscodecontentref_/0) to register the new route.
   - Created [tsla-dashboard](http://_vscodecontentref_/1) with:
     - `TslaDashboard.tsx`: Renders the dashboard layout and includes graph placeholders.
     - `components/PriceGraph.tsx` and `components/SentimentGraph.tsx`: Simple components with styled “Graph goes here” placeholders.
     - `TslaDashboard.module.css`: Contains all styles for the dashboard feature.

3. **Home Page Update**
   - Updated the Home page to include a button linking to `/tsla-dashboard`.
   - Refactored [DeployButton](http://_vscodecontentref_/2):
     - Removed the external link logic.
     - Used Next.js `<Link>` for internal navigation.
     - Changed button text to “TSLA Dashboard”.

4. **Best Practices**
   - Ensured all internal navigation uses `<Link>` for optimal SSR/SPA experience.
   - Scoped all new styles to the feature module.

## Result

- The project now has a clean, maintainable structure for the TSLA dashboard feature.
- Navigation from the Home page to the dashboard uses best practices for Next.js.
- All new styles are feature-scoped.
- The codebase is ready for further UI and data integration for the TSLA dashboard.
