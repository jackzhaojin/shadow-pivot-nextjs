# AI Chat Log: Refactor to Component-Driven Development & Docker Layer Caching

## Date

2025-05-26

## Topics Covered

- Refactoring to component-driven development (React/Next.js)
- Docker layer caching in GitHub Actions
- Project structure and workflow improvements

## Commands Used

- `git mv` and `git add` for file and folder changes
- `npm install` for dependency management
- Docker build and run commands for local testing
- GitHub Actions workflow runs for CI/CD

## Files Changed

### app/layout.tsx

- Updated to use custom fonts and global styles
- Ensured children are wrapped with correct font classes

### app/page.tsx

- Changed to render the new `Home` component from `features/home/Home.tsx`

### features/home/components/DocsButton.tsx

- Added a new reusable DocsButton component for documentation links

### features/home/components/DeployButton.tsx

- Extracted DeployButton as a standalone component for deployment actions

### features/home/components/FooterLink.tsx

- Extracted FooterLink as a reusable component for footer navigation

### features/home/components/Logo.tsx

- Extracted Logo as a reusable component for branding

### .dockerignore

- Updated to ignore new folders and files (e.g., `.github`, `local-only`, `/docs`)

### .gitignore

- Added/updated rules for local-only files, build artifacts, and environment files

### docs/ai-log/2025-05-26-summary.md

- Created and updated this summary log for tracking AI-assisted changes

## Component Extraction Details

- The following components were extracted from the main page for reusability and maintainability:
  - `DocsButton`: Documentation link button
  - `DeployButton`: Deployment action button
  - `FooterLink`: Footer navigation link
  - `Logo`: Brand/logo display
- Each component now resides in `features/home/components/` and is imported as needed in the main UI

## Outcomes

- UI refactored into reusable components (DocsButton, DeployButton, FooterLink, Logo)
- Project structure supports component-driven workflows
- Dockerfile and GitHub Actions updated for efficient build caching
- Improved documentation and traceability of changes
